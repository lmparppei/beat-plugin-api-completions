# Beat Plugin API Autocompletion for VS Code

This is a bare-bones autocompletion extension for Beat Plugin API. It provides documentation and completions for the base `Beat.` methods and properties. It **doesn't** support autocompletions for `Line` or `OutlineScene` objects for now, mostly because Beat Plugin API doesn't currently support TypeScript.

The extension can still streamline your experience when writing a plugin for Beat and lets you spend more time actually coding and less time looking through the (badly written) plugin Wiki.
